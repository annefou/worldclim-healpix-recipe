"""BIOCLIM conventions: the same variable names are computed differently by different sources.

- ``"population"``: population standard deviation (divide by n), CV of monthly precipitation
  (CHELSA v2.1).
- ``"dismo"``: sample standard deviation (divide by n-1), CV of monthly precipitation + 1 mm
  (R's dismo::biovars; WorldClim 2.1).

``convention="as-published"`` keeps the source's own values. Another convention is applied exactly:

- bio4 is rescaled by sqrt(11/12) or sqrt(12/11): both use the same 12 monthly values;
- bio15 also needs bio12 of the same source: adding 1 mm to every month leaves the standard
  deviation unchanged and raises the mean m = bio12 / 12 by 1, so
  CV_population = CV_dismo * (m + 1) / m * sqrt(11/12), and the inverse. Where m = 0 (no rain at
  all) the population CV is undefined (missing) and the dismo CV is exactly 0.

Checked against CV recomputed from the monthly layers: ratio 1.00000 (WorldClim to population) and
1.0000 +- 0.0009 (CHELSA to dismo; CHELSA stores values to 0.1). Variables defined the same way in
both conventions (bio1, bio12) are unchanged.
